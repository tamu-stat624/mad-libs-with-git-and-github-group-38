Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Dobby,

I am writing to you from a sparkling spaceship in a cozy galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a cyan rocket in February. There are 22 Aliens and Dinosaurs of Planet here! In the
GateWay there is a pool full of Bromine. I fall asleep each night on a toxic bed of
Arsenic and dream of sleeping quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
22 Seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
jumping on a big cycle!!

Best wishes,
Harry p
